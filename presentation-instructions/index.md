ETD 2024 will be a hybrid conference, which leads to a fact that organizing paper presentation at ETD conference this year is much more challenging than ever before. There are many foreseeable issues in paper presentation on ETD 2024, e.g. lack of interaction, insecurity/unreliable network connection, etc. To provide an enjoyable virtual conference, we need to mitigate these issues by asking our authors for extra materials, e.g. pre-recorded videos, meta information, etc. Moreover, this year ETD received the largest number of submissions in ETD history and accepted 147 full papers and 152 short papers, which is awesome. At the same time, this brings to a larger number of parallel sessions for paper presentations. As a response, we decided to reduce the number of parallel sessions by randomly allocating non-working hours to some accepted papers.

We are committed to develop a conference program which is convenient for people in our community all around the world regardless of the challenges in organizing a virtual conference. We will not only provide the authors with appropriate time periods for paper presentation, but also provide all the attendees with flexible and enjoyable events in the conference. The conference schedule therefore lasts almost 24 hours per day during the main conference and we design different forms of presentation for papers with different categories shown below.

<hr>
## FULL PAPER PRESENTATION

Each full paper should be presented by an author (presenter). The presenters are expected to provide a prerecorded 15-min video (720p) which will be presented at the conference Web portal during the conference period. The video as well as other paper information should be submitted to the conference portal. Instructions on how to submit the corresponding information will be sent to the authors via a separate email.

The presenter is also expected to give a live talk (15 mins' presentation + 5 minsâ€™ Q&A) on Zoom meeting in the corresponding full paper session. In case of emergent network connection problem during the live talk, the volunteer serving for the session can play the prerecorded video for the paper. However, most full paper presenters are expected to give a live talk for paper presentation instead of using a prerecorded video. 

For further discussions, each full paper can apply for a time slot of Zoom virtual discussion room. Details can be found in section VIRTUAL DISCUSSION ROOM.

## SHORT PAPER PRESENTATION

The authors of each short paper are expected to submit a 10-min prerecorded video (720p) which will be presented at the conference Web portal during the conference.

The authors are also expected to interact with the participants via the online discussion forum on the Web portal during the corresponding short paper session.

## VIRTUAL DISCUSSION ROOM 

To facilitate the interactions between participants, we set up TEN virtual discussion rooms, each of which can hold up to 200 attendees. Each full/short/TOIS/industry track/demo paper can apply for a time slot of half an hour in a virtual room. Each time slot will be coordinated by the applicant with the help of a volunteer. The time slot information for the paper will also be updated on the Web portal so that participants can choose their interested discussions to attend. The application of time slots should be performed while submitting the video and paper information to the conference Web portal. We apply "first come, first served" policy to the allocation of slots.

The available time slots for discussion rooms are given as follows. (Time zone: GMT+8)
