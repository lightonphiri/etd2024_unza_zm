                            As per the SIGIR executive committee’s statement at
                            <a
                                href="https://medium.com/@carteret.acm/statement-from-the-sigir-executive-committee-on-covid-19-cba4b8084391">
                                Statement from the SIGIR Executive Committee on COVID-19</a>,
                            “ETD 2024 is currently planned to remain in Xi’an, July 25–30.” “Experts believe that the
                            virus will be well under control by July.” “ETD 2024 has received a record number of
                            submissions, with by far the largest number coming from China, which contributes to our
                            position that it is best to keep the conference in China if at all possible.” However, the
                            committee is also preparing for two contingencies: 1) possible move to Toronto (to be
                            confirmed during April) and 2) availability for remote presentations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In line with the above, the Doctoral Consortium organization is willing to be flexible
                            regarding travel restrictions that may apply at the moment of attending the conference due
                            to health recommendations or visa problems in case SIGIR ends up changing location. We still
                            expect to provide mentoring opportunities that will benefit students' future work. We are
                            looking into options for having remote one-on-one mentoring sessions and presentations if
                            needed.

                        <p>
                            SIGIR is the major international forum for the presentation of new research results and for
                            the demonstration of new systems and techniques in the broad field of information retrieval
                            (IR). The ACM ETD 2024 Doctoral Consortium will provide doctoral students with a unique
                            opportunity to have substantive interaction with other researchers regarding their proposed
                            dissertation research.

                            The objectives of the Doctoral Consortium are:

                            The Consortium will take place the day before the main conference (on Sunday, July 26th,
                            2020), with the format including: student presentations with plenary discussions, individual
                            1:1 meetings with experienced researchers, interactive networking sessions over lunch, and
                            panel sessions with a special emphasis on gaining insights regarding career paths after the
                            PhD. <br />
                            <strong> Update</strong>: Note that the final format is subject to change due to possible
                            need to
                            accommodate remote presentations and 1:1 mentoring meetings.

                        <p>
                            Prospective attendees should have written, or be close to completing, a thesis proposal (or
                            equivalent). It is desirable that students not be so close to completing their PhD that the
                            event would have little impact on their work, or so early that a topic has not been chosen.
                            Before submitting, students should discuss this criterion with their advisor or supervisor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To apply for a place at the Doctoral Consortium, candidates should submit a paper up to 5+1
                            pages in length, <strong>solely </strong> authored by the student - see submission
                            guidelines below.
                            Candidates will be selected based on the potential of their research for future impact on
                            the field of information retrieval, as well as for the likely benefit to the student from
                            participating in the Consortium. We note that ETD 2024 DC is deeply committed to improving
                            the field of IR by making it more diverse, equitable, and inclusive. We highly encourage
                            women and students from other underrepresented groups to apply.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For each selected student, a one page extended abstract will be published in the ETD 2024
                            Conference Proceedings. Extended abstracts will be invited after selection, and should not
                            be submitted with the proposal. <br/> <strong>Update</strong>: The deadline for the one page abstracts is set by
                            the publisher, but it will likely be on or around May 14. Accepted DC authors will be
                            contacted by the publisher with further instructions.

                            Doctoral students who submit to the Consortium are allowed to have previously published
                            their research, and are encouraged to submit full, short, or demo papers of their work to
                            the ETD 2024 conference and associated workshops.

                            Priority is given to students chosen to attend the Consortium when travel grants are
                            determined for the conference, and generally grants will be awarded to chosen students.
                            Application details for travel grants will be available on the ETD 2024 website (You must
                            apply for the grant to be considered).
