                            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                                Located in the Kazungula District of Zambiaâ€™s Southern Province, Mukuni Village is a historic settlement just seven kilometers from the iconic Victoria Falls. Originally founded in the 13th century by Bedyango, the Leya Tribal Matriarch, the village was known as Gundu. In the 17th century, it was renamed Mukuni Village in honor of Mukokalya Mukuni N'gombe, a revered leader.

                                The Mukuni Chiefdom is expansive, with over 100 smaller villages spread across the region. There are twelve schools and four rural health centers located in Mukuni, N'Songwe, Katapazi, and Mahalulu. The Butterfly Tree charity has played a crucial role in supporting education and health initiatives in the area, building the first high school and a special education unit in the district. In addition to these efforts, new schools have been constructed in N'dele, Chuunga, and Malima, while existing schools in other villages have been expanded or supported, ensuring access to education for children throughout the Chiefdom.                            </p>

                            <p>Mukuni Village, the heart of the Mukuni Chiefdom, is home to over 8,000 residents and sits atop a dry, sandy knoll. Due to the area's infertile soil, traditional farming is difficult, so the community has embraced tourism as a vital source of income. Today, Mukuni Village offers visitors a glimpse into the rich cultural heritage of the Leya people. The village boasts a growing curios market where artisans sell beautifully crafted wood carvings, stoneware, jewelry, and baskets.</p>
