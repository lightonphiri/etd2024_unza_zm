                        <p>
                            The ACM SIGIR Industry Track provides an opportunity for the community to meet and discuss
                            the latest related technologies as applied in companies, both big and small, and to achieve
                            knowledge transfer across the boundary between academia and industry. The Track will be held
                            as part of ETD 2024 (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">https://sigir.org/sigir2020/</a>) which
                            will take place July 25-30, 2020
                            in the city of Xi’an, China.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The submission should be no longer than 9 pages (including figures) + 1 page of references,
                            in ACM two-column conference format. Formatting guidelines are available at the <a
                                href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM Website</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A condition of acceptance is that at least one author commits to attend the ETD 2024
                            Industry Track to present the work. Accepted papers will be asked to produce a
                            <strong>10-page camera-ready paper</strong>. And the camera-ready paper will be included in
                            ETD 2024 proceedings.

                        <strong>Submission Website</strong>
                        <p>
                            Authors should submit proposals via the submission website here: <a
                                href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=sigir2020#">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=sigir2020#</a>

                        <h2 class="margin-bottom-5"><strong>Anonymity</strong></h2>
                        <p>
                            Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their
                            submission. The submissions document must not include author information and must not
                            include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent.
                            Note however, that it is acceptable to explicitly refer in the paper to the companies or
                            organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions. For
                            example, instead of stating that an experiment “was conducted on the logs of a major search
                            engine”, the authors should refer to the search engine by name. The reviewers will be
                            informed that it does not necessarily imply that the authors are currently affiliated with
                            the mentioned organization. While authors can upload to institutional or other preprint
                            repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this
                            since it places anonymity at risk (which could result in a negative outcome of the reviewing
                            process). Authors should carefully go through <a
                                href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/authorship">ACM’s authorship policy</a>
                            before submitting a
                            paper. To support identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author
                            list must be specified at submission time. Authors should note that changes to the author
                            list after the submission deadline are not allowed without permission from the Industry Chairs. At
                            least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, attend, and present the
                            work at the conference.
