                        <p>
                            SIGIR is the major international forum for the presentation of new research results and for
                            the demonstration of new systems and techniques in the broad field of Information Retrieval
                            (IR). ETD 2024 will be held in Xi’an, China from 25 to 30 July 2020.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Demonstrations present first-hand experience with research prototypes or operational
                            systems. They provide opportunities to exchange ideas gained from implementing IR systems,
                            and to obtain feedback from expert users. We cordially invite all those working in areas
                            related to IR to submit original proposals for demonstrations. Proposals from startups and
                            industry players are also welcomed. Accepted demonstration submissions will appear in the
                            conference proceedings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A good demonstration submission should be interesting to a SIGIR audience and should show a
                            novel solution to a problem. The demonstration submission should address the following
                            questions: Who is your target user? Why does your system exist and why is it important? What
                            does your demonstration do and how does it work? What does it look like? How does it compare
                            with existing systems? Finally, how and when might your technology have an impact, either
                            technically or commercially?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Demonstration submissions are welcome in any of the areas related to any aspects of IR, as
                            identified in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/call-for-full-papers">Call for Full Papers</a>

                        <p>
                            Submissions of demonstration papers must be in English and can be up to 4 pages in SIGIR
                            format (including references and figures). The first 2 pages are expected to describe your
                            system. The third and fourth pages are expected to be used for diagrams, images, references,
                            screen shots, hyperlinks, and demo requirements. You should expect wireless network access,
                            along with a table and poster mount backdrop, will be provided for all accepted
                            demonstrations. We cannot guarantee additional technical or practical requests. Upon
                            acceptance, all pages will be published in the SIGIR proceedings.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To help reviewers and readers of your demonstration paper intuitively and fully understand
                            your system, your demonstration submission should include either a link to a <strong>video
                                capture</strong>
                            or a link to the <strong>online web interface</strong> of your system (login details shall
                            be specified in
                            your submission if applicable).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please note that, unlike short and full paper submissions, demonstration submissions are
                            <strong>single blind</strong>. You are not expected to take measures to conceal your
                            identity from reviewers.
