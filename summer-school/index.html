                                    Abstract: Traditionally Web search engines returned the same results to everyone who
                                    asks the same question. However, using a single ranking for everyone in every
                                    context at every point in time limits how well a search engine can do in providing
                                    relevant information. In this talk I present a framework to quantify the "potential
                                    for personalization” which is used to characterize the extent to which different
                                    people have different intents for the same query. I describe several examples of how
                                    different types of contextual features are represented and used to improve search
                                    quality for individuals and groups. Finally, I conclude by highlighting important
                                    challenges in developing personalized systems at Web scale including privacy,
                                    transparency, serendipity, and evaluation.

                                    Abstract: It is an intuitive hypothesis that techniques from natural language
                                    processing (NLP) should improve information retrieval (IR). Surely,
                                    attempts to understand the meaning of texts would help systems better
                                    provide users with relevant information? Yet, the history of IR is
                                    littered with ideas from NLP that intuitively "should work", but never
                                    panned out, at least with the implementations at the time. Two
                                    examples from the 1990s include word sense disambiguation (WSD) and
                                    linguistic indexing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In this talk, I will discuss my own personal journey over the past two
                                    decades grappling with this hypothesis, culminating in recent advances
                                    in transformer architectures as applied to information access
                                    problems. BERT, the most famous of these models, is I believe the
                                    first NLP technique that has unequivocally improved information
                                    access. Thus, we are at an exciting and unique moment where NLP and IR
                                    have come together at last, producing a fertile research landscape
                                    full of interesting possibilities. In the hopes of stirring up some
                                    discussion, I'll offer the following slogan: NLP makes IR interesting
                                    and IR makes NLP useful.

                                        Professor Jimmy Lin holds the David R. Cheriton Chair in the David
                                        R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of
                                        Waterloo. Lin's research aims to build tools that help users make
                                        sense of large amounts of data. His work mostly lies at the
                                        intersection of information retrieval and natural language processing,
                                        with a focus on data-driven approaches and infrastructure
                                        issues. Although most of Lin's work deals with text, he's also worked
                                        on relational data, semi-structured data, log data, speech, and
                                        graphs. From 2010-2012, Lin spent an extended sabbatical at Twitter,
                                        where he worked on services designed to connect users with relevant
                                        content and analytics infrastructure to support data science. He
                                        currently serves as the Chief Scientist of RSVP.ai, a Waterloo-based
                                        startup that aims to build deep natural language understanding
                                        technologies to facilitate seamless dialogues between users and
                                        systems.

                                    Abstract: Language models can be pre-trained at a very large scale by noising and
                                    then reconstructing any input text. Existing methods, based on variations of masked
                                    languages models, have transformed the field and now provide the de facto
                                    initialization to be tuned for nearly any NLP task. In this tutorial, I will review
                                    recent work in language model pretraining, from ELMo and BERT to more recent models.
                                    I will aim for broad coverage but provide more details on the models we have been
                                    developing recently in FAIR Seattle. These including in particular pre-training
                                    methods for sequence-to-sequence model, such as BART, mBART, and MARGE, which
                                    provide some of the most generally applicable approaches to date.

                                    part of reporting in the IR research community. In this tutorial, I will provide an overview
                                    of the main offline and online techniques that are used to evaluate search engines.
                                    Topics covered in the tutorial will include the classic test collection based
                                    approach, statistical significance testing, user evaluation, ethics approval, AB
                                    testing, and the recent innovation in counterfactual evaluation, where offline
                                    collections can be induced from online click data. At the end of this tutorial,
                                    students will understand the principles, methods, and resources available for
